# Release Notes

## v0.3.0

-	Major rewrite of tracking pipeline: New adaptive frame-skipping tracker using heatmap + Siamese fusion, with robust background subtraction and confidence-based control. Tracking loop now fully decoupled and externally controlled via run_tracking().
-	GUI tracking overhaul: Replaced static loop with responsive UI integration and live progress feedback (ProgressReporter), exposing threshold controls and skip stride interactively.
-	Unified dataset system: Introduced DetectionDataset and restructured TrackingDataset with shared design, supporting data splits, augmentation, jitter, negatives, and Gaussian heatmaps.
-	Model architecture refinement: Removed unused decoder depth; simplified upsampling blocks using bilinear interpolation and batch norm; Siamese tracker now reuses encoder blocks and merges features more effectively.
-	Calibration update: Added precise point rectification method to support accurate coordinate mapping.
